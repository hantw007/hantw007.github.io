Abstract

:    A step is taken towards fusing symbolic and decision-theoretic problem solving in a cognitive architecture by implementing the latter in an architecture within which the former has already been demonstrated. The graphical models upon which the architecture is based enable a uniform implementation of both varieties of problem solving. They also enable a uniform combination with forms of decision-relevant perception, highlighting a potential path towards a tight coupling between central cognition and peripheral perception.
