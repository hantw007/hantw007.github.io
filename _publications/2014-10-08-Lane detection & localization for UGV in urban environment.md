Abstract

:    Generally, the main components of autonomous driving system consists of perception (geometry recognition, localization, and objects detection & tracking) and navigation processes (global & local path planning, and controller). In this paper, we focus on finding an accurate position for Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) in urban environments. A GPS sensor is fundamentally used to get a current global position, but its accuracy is susceptible to satellite geometry or receiver's conditions; even though high performance guaranteed GPS such as differential-GPS (DGPS) always return precise position(position error is less than 0.4m) because of problems such as disconnection between base station and vehicle. The position-errors, even few meters, could engender serious accidents when UGV is driving under urban environments. In this paper, we suggest the localization algorithm and novel lane detection algorithm. The detected lane information is implemented to overcome GPS sensor's position-errors. First, our novel lane detection algorithm is described, and then the localization algorithm is discussed. This paper also provides experimental results of the lane-detection and the localization in urban environment by using UGV.
