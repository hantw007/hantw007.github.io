## Overview of an online evolving method: evolving Finite State Machine (e-FSM)

An online evolving method named evolving Finite State Machine (e-FSM) can determine unknown states (situations) and identify transitions. At a moment, it is similar to Markov Chain, but its structure evolves over time. This approach enables controllers to recognize unexpected situations and learn optimal controls (or decisions) over time. Also, the e-FSM is fully explainalbe while Deep Neural Network is not.

## What is the optimal control?
* Choosing actions to satisfy the given criteria.
* Trade-off between conflicted criterion (e.g., safety and speed)
  * Latent factors (for the future) can be useful.
  * Recognition of unknown situations
