title: "Evolving Finite State Machine (e-FSM)"
excerpt: "An online evolving method named evolving Finite State Machine (e-FSM) can determine unknown states (situations) and identify transitions. At a moment, it is similar to Markov Chain, but its structure evolves over time. This approach enables controllers to recognize unexpected situations and learn optimal decisions over time. Also, the e-FSM is fully explainalbe while Deep Neural Network does not."
